# Introduction

Workflow engines are now widely used for genome analysis workflows.
On the other hand, there are still difficulties to build and execute their workflows in various aspects.
For example:
- How to develop our workflows in workflow languages such as CWL, snakemake, nextflow, and others?
- How to integrate our workflows with containers such as Docker, Singularity, and Podman?
- How to integrate our workflows with job schedulers such as Slurm and GridEngine?

To solve these problems, our group did the following:
- Cooperate with other groups to develop their workflows,
- Cooperate with other groups to make their workflow integrated with containers, and
- Develop and improve workflow ecosystems to remove the barriors to develop and execute their workflows. Ecosystems include workflow executors, specifications of workflow languages, workflow-related tools

This paper reports what we did during the DBCLS BioHackathon 2024.

# Formatting

This document use Markdown and you can look at [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of only two levels.

## Tables and figures

Tables can be added in the following way, though alternatives are possible:

Table: Note that table caption is automatically numbered and should be
given before the table itself.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

A figure is added with:

![Caption for BioHackrXiv logo figure](./biohackrxiv.png)

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Lists can be added with:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use [CiTO](http://purl.org/spar/cito/2018-02-12) annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate _why_ you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

The syntax in Markdown is as follows: a single intention annotation looks like
`[@usesMethodIn:Krewinkel2017]`; two or more intentions are separated
with colons, like `[@extends:discusses:Nielsen2017Scholia]`. When you cite two
different articles, you use this syntax: `[@citesAsDataSource:Ammar2022ETL; @citesAsDataSource:Arend2022BioHackEU22]`.

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* citesAsEvidence
* citesAsPotentialSolution
* citesAsRecommendedReading
* citesAsRelated
* citesAsSourceDocument
* citesForInformation
* confirms
* documents
* providesDataFor
* obtainsSupportFrom
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
* updates
* citation: generic citation
